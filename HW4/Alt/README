All I did for HW4 was the alternate version. The CheckHW4alt script works with the input file I provided so hopefully my code works for yours too. 
I have three java files called: Priority.java, Item.java, and Node.java and they all seem to work fine. Hope my code isn't too hard to grade. Thank you!

standardInput.c 
For me when the program runs, it's waiting for the user to input stuff before
it actually prompts the user to do what it wants. I'm not sure why this is 
because I copied and pasted the program straight from the lab. It works properly
when you input the right things but it prints everything after an argument is read in.

hello.c, CommandLineArguments.c, FileIO.c, and FileReverse.c all work properly it's just 
the minor bug in standardInput.c that's not working perfectly. Again I'm not sure why it 
doesn't prompt the user before it takes in the arguments.

FileIO.c
Takes in the file "input.txt" and is outputted to file "output"

FileReverse.c
Takes in the file "in" and is outputted to file "out"

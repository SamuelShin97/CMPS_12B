On execution of charType, all this memory stuff is printed out and I'm not sure what all that stuff
is, but the program works the way it's supposed to and valgrind reports no memory leaks so I'm 
pretty sure that it's ok. Just do "cat out" after all the weird memory statements are printed out
and the correct output is there. Other than that, everything works the way it's supposed to 
including the makefile and valgrind. Thank you!

Lab 5 has all the files needed to get full credit. However, this lab was super unclear in what 
we needed to do. I'm sure you guys have heard many complaints on Lab5 and I'm sorry that you
guys had to take all this heat. I know you guys are doing the best you you guys can with the 
limited staff members available. It was just a rough week for both students and staff. Anyways,
I tried my best to fulfill the requirements for this lab. My output is correct, the makefile looks
good to me, and valgrind reports no memory leaks. So hopefully I can get full credit on this lab
but again the directions were unclear and I'm not really sure if I did Dictionary.h and Dictionary.c
correctly. But what I did works on the example in the lab description so... yeah I don't know. Have mercy.

HW5 contains Bard.java and works the way it should by taking in a file called input.txt and outputs an analysis of the file shakespeare.txt to a
file called analysis.txt. There shouldn't be any problems with the Makefile or the actual assignem program itself and the grading script seems to
work. Happy grading and thanks for an awesome quarter!
